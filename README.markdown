Swipe Style Keyboards for iOS
=========

A quick hack to do a keyboard that behaves like the swype keyboard- needs a bit more work to get it into something that is worth working on further

#### New iOS keyboard ####
Swipe keyboard proto

###  This project uses code from:
Kulpreet Chilana- borrowed the keyboards
Apple, Inc. - borrowed some of the opengl code

### Current Status
1. this project uses the predicted frequencies of the conjoined letters rather than a dictionary
2. the letter collection algorithm needs to be more adaptive to the speed of the user
3. the letter identification should be more fuzzy than current
4. need to hook up the ipad keyboard
